## Hello, I'm Danish! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ I recently graduated from the University of London with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, specializing in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

ðŸŽµ I'm passionate about merging technology and creativity, which has led me to work on music production AIs. My latest project involves developing a program that uses AI to generate and produce musical ideas and melodies.

ðŸ’» Current Projects:

- Music AI Generator: A program that leverages machine learning techniques to create innovative musical compositions.

ðŸ”§ Technical Skills:

- Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript, C++
- Machine Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, DeepSpeech
- Other Frameworks: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, Librosa
- Music Production Tools: Ableton Live, Logic Pro

ðŸŒŸ Goals:

- Enhance my skills in AI-driven music production.
- Collaborate on open-source projects related to machine learning and creativity.
